jQuery Reel Non-Looping Stitched Panorama Example
=================================================

This example demonstrates a stitched panorama, which doesn't loop
around. One that has a start and a finish. It is virtually divided into
30 steps, starts on 13th step and animates start to finish in 10 seconds.
When it reaches the one end of the pano, it revereses the motion and
heads to the other end with the same speed. This one also has a custom
interaction timeout of exactly 1 second.

It also showcases positioning of several annotations.
